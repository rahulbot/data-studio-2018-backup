				<description><![CDATA[Our goal was to get people to reflect on what trees mean to them to personalize the issue that we are presenting. We wanted to encourage people to reach out to the Urban Forestry Department to request a tree in their neighborhood. Our audience was Somerville residents, as well as others who work, shop, visit, use public services in the city. We were focusing on pedestrians, as they are better able to engage with participatory sculpture.  &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/05/17/building-back-somervilles-urban-forest-impact/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Building back Somerville’s urban forest &#8211; Impact</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[We decided to create a new project to engage members of the community in an urban issue, rather than iterating on a previous idea. We wanted to portray the importance of trees by telling a story of the absence of one; specifically, creating shade in a place without trees on a sunny day with help from the community. For that, we decided to create the chalk outline of a shadow to show the full potential of &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/05/17/building-back-somervilles-urban-forest-methodology/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Building back Somerville’s urban forest &#8211; Methodology</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Trucking bees all over the country is a powerful image. Most people don’t realize what happens behind the scenes to produce the food they eat every day. During this class we have enjoyed exploring datasets and finding creative ways to turn csv’s into narratives that stick in people’s heads. We were drawn to study bees because of the strong narrative that has been in press in recent years that has made many people vaguely aware &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/05/17/adventures-of-a-frequent-flyer-impact/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Adventures of a Frequent Flyer &#8211; Impact</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[We started with the example bee colony dataset that was included in the project suggestions. From there, we explored how bee populations have changed over time. It was clear from the data that bee populations have rebounded to a certain extend from their low points about 5 years ago. We explored what are the biggest risks facing bees, finding articles about pesticides, mites, and accidents related to the transport of bees in trucks. https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/bee-truck-carrying-14-million-insects-crashes-on-to-highway-10186669.html Curious &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/05/17/adventures-of-a-frequent-flyer-methodology/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Adventures of a Frequent Flyer &#8211; Methodology</span></a>]]></description>

We focused on data related to Massachusetts so that individuals would have a more personal connection to the data.

				<description><![CDATA[Bee Colony Collapse Disorder has been known for a while, but there is still a lot of mystery around the causes of this phenomenon. There have been numerous approaches to solving the issue, from robotic bees to redesigning of hives. We believe that a solution can be found only if people from unconventional fields decide to take on the problem and explore new methods to answer unconsidered questions. &#160; We decided to specifically target MIT &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/05/16/its-a-mysterbee-impact/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">It&#8217;s a Mysterbee: Impact</span></a>]]></description>

We want to tell this story because we all benefit from trees on our streets and in our parks, but we often take them for granted and ignore the threats they face.
