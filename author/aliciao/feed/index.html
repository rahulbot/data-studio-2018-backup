We focused on data related to Massachusetts so that individuals would have a more personal connection to the data.

There have been numerous approaches to solving the issue, from robotic bees to redesigning of hives. We believe that a solution can be found only if people from unconventional fields decide to take on the problem and explore new methods to answer unconsidered questions. &#160; We decided to specifically target MIT &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/05/16/its-a-mysterbee-impact/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">It&#8217;s a Mysterbee: Impact</span></a>]]></description>

We looked at the natural gas dataset, and decided to focus on “lost” leaks and “found leaks. “Found” leaks are natural gas leaks that have been are recorded by the natural gas utilities through the years as unrepaired.

				<description><![CDATA[The wall that President Trump wants between the United States and Mexico is a highly politicized topic. Perhaps that&#8217;s why NYT&#8217;s visualization has a neutral invitation as its title: &#8220;See what&#8217;s in place already.&#8221; The visualization&#8217;s ideal audience are US citizens who are uninformed about the current border, from all types of political background.
