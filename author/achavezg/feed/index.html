				<description><![CDATA[Trucking bees all over the country is a powerful image. Most people don’t realize what happens behind the scenes to produce the food they eat every day. During this class we have enjoyed exploring datasets and finding creative ways to turn csv’s into narratives that stick in people’s heads. We were drawn to study bees because of the strong narrative that has been in press in recent years that has made many people vaguely aware &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/05/17/adventures-of-a-frequent-flyer-impact/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Adventures of a Frequent Flyer &#8211; Impact</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[We started with the example bee colony dataset that was included in the project suggestions. From there, we explored how bee populations have changed over time. It was clear from the data that bee populations have rebounded to a certain extend from their low points about 5 years ago. We explored what are the biggest risks facing bees, finding articles about pesticides, mites, and accidents related to the transport of bees in trucks. https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/bee-truck-carrying-14-million-insects-crashes-on-to-highway-10186669.html Curious &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/05/17/adventures-of-a-frequent-flyer-methodology/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Adventures of a Frequent Flyer &#8211; Methodology</span></a>]]></description>

Building upon the knowledge of CO2 emissions in our last sketch, we were interested to take a closer look at the heterogeneity in efficiency across cars models on the market, one of the leading sources of CO2. It is common knowledge that auto emissions contribute significantly to pollution, but it is less clear that people &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/04/12/road-to-sustainability/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Road to Sustainability</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[When we saw this photo, we were shocked. In the press, Beijing has stood out for the levels of pollution. Before the 2008 Olympics, visitors and athletes alike voiced concern over the quality of the air. Since then, by the US State Department data, it has become worse. Diving into the data we noticed that Beijing’s air quality is not as simple a story as it is sometimes reported. There is wide variation in the &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/03/22/where-did-beijing-go-and-will-it-come-back/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Where did Beijing go and will it come back?</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The data says that some of the largest economies are far from meeting their Paris Agreement CO2 reduction targets.   We wanted to tell this story because the ability to credibly commit to sustainable practices will be essential to preventing catastrophic climate changes. Just as many individuals commit to lose weight but fail to follow through, many national regimes to reduce carbon emissions are off track. To make this issue more relatable to our audience, we &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/03/08/doctors-orders-for-co2-emissions-reduction/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Doctor&#8217;s Orders for CO2 Emissions Reduction</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[People often feel a connection to their community/town/region, manifesting itself most ostensibly in the support of a sports team. While the borders between cities, counties, and states are often arbitrary, social media lets us see how our allegiances truly lie around this country. This New York Times visualization shows which MLB teams have the greatest fraction of Facebook likes within a zip code. Aggregating the data literally paints an interesting picture, in some cases redrawing &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/02/08/redrawing-borders-using-facebook-likes/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Redrawing Borders using Facebook Likes</span></a>]]></description>
