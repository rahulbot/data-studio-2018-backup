				<description><![CDATA[In China, over 1.3 billion people have high health risks associated with exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The data says that the air quality in major cities in China exceeds the World Health Organization (WHO) Air Quality Guidelines (AQG). However, it is hard for people in the U.S. to experience that.  About the PM2.5, I experience it myself. This is a real story: In 2015, during the fall break, I went back to my &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/03/22/all-i-want-for-christmas-is-clean-air/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">All I Want for Christmas is Clean Air</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The data say that Beijing’s pollution has been getting a lot better over the past few years, but is still a lot higher than their target of 30 microgram per meter cube. We want to tell this story because it tells a story that’s not the common narrative: yes the pollution is bad, but it is getting a lot better. Our audience is Americans interested in China. There are a few interesting notes about the &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/03/22/beijing-needs-to-breathe/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Beijing needs to breathe!</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[How does it feel to breathe in Beijing? We are exploring the US Department of State &#8220;Mission China&#8221; Air Quality dataset in an effort to recreate the experience of breathing with varying degrees of difficulty. We are grouping the data into three categories: good air quality, moderate, and low.  With each category, a different breathing experience aims to be simulated using different straws. We believe this is a powerful physical data experience because it is simple &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/03/22/breathing-beijing/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Breathing Beijing</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Scott Gilman, Sofia Reinach, Maddie Pelz The data say that while some countries contribute more than their share of harmful emissions leading to climate change, these are not the same countries that will suffer the biggest consequences due to climate change. We want to tell this story to point out the imbalance of cause and consequences of climate change, and to encourage people in the US and elsewhere to take action to reduce their climate &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/03/22/tipping-the-scales-of-climate-justice/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Tipping the Scales of Climate Justice</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[When we saw this photo, we were shocked. In the press, Beijing has stood out for the levels of pollution. Before the 2008 Olympics, visitors and athletes alike voiced concern over the quality of the air. Since then, by the US State Department data, it has become worse. Diving into the data we noticed that Beijing’s air quality is not as simple a story as it is sometimes reported. There is wide variation in the &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/03/22/where-did-beijing-go-and-will-it-come-back/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Where did Beijing go and will it come back?</span></a>]]></description>
