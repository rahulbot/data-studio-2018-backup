				<description><![CDATA[By Helen Bailey, Scott Gilman, Sofia Reinach, &#38; Olivia Brode-Roger The data say that Somerville’s many trees face several vulnerabilities, including their health and proximity to unrepaired natural gas leaks that can suffocate their roots. We want to tell this story because we all benefit from trees on our streets and in our parks, but we often take them for granted and ignore the threats they face.
