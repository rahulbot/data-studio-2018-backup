				<description><![CDATA[We chose to do a sketch using the dataset that deals with Fuel Economy, supplemented by 2018 starting price from Kelly Blue Book (www.kbb.com),  and propose a sketch with the following characteristics: Goal: to encourage people to buy more fuel efficient cars. Audience: current car buyers who  are not experts about different features and parts in cars (and have some 1990s video game nostalgia). We envision this being an ad or feature on a car-buying &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/04/12/332/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Build it Better</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Helen Bailey, Maddie Pelz &#38; Yihang Sui &#160; This rich historical dataset dating back to the early 800s suggests that the full flowering date of the cherry trees in Kyoto have become increasingly early across time. We want to tell this story because cherry blossoms are an important part of Japanese culture, and are an example of the many species of plants being threatened by climate change. As members of the travel bureau, our audience &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/04/12/kyoto-community-flower-diary/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Kyoto Community Flower Diary</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Project Title: Rent the Raceway Team Member Names: Haley Meisenholder, Olivia Brode-Roger, Alicia Ouyang, Mitchel Myers Description: The data says that there are vehicles which are much more fuel efficient than others. These more efficient vehicles produce less harmful emissions and result in monetary savings for users. We want to tell this story because it is relevant to the environment, quality of life, and spending capacity of vehicle renters. Our audience is car renters. Specifically, we hope to &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/04/12/sketch-3-rent-the-raceway/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Sketch 3: Rent the Raceway</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Kunyi Li, Caroline Liu, Margaret Sands, and Arturo Chavez The data say that fuel economy for consumer vehicles varies dramatically. Building upon the knowledge of CO2 emissions in our last sketch, we were interested to take a closer look at the heterogeneity in efficiency across cars models on the market, one of the leading sources of CO2. It is common knowledge that auto emissions contribute significantly to pollution, but it is less clear that people &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/04/12/road-to-sustainability/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Road to Sustainability</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[By Marc Exposito, Scott Gilman, and Kalli Retzepi The data say that the Arctic is melting quickly, which threatens many species that live there. We wanted to tell this story because the Arctic is already experiencing the effects of climate change more than almost anywhere else on the planet, and yet it’s easy to ignore what’s happening there as it feels so removed from our world. Our audience is students in their 20s or 30s &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/04/12/polar-jenga-how-can-you-keep-the-ice-from-melting/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Polar Jenga &#8211; How long can you keep the ice from melting?</span></a>]]></description>
