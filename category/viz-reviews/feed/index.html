				<description><![CDATA[I think this is my favorite visualization (not because of the topic) but because they have managed to nail down a very specific and powerful narrative: not how many people died, but how many years were not lived. It&#8217;s a great example of something that I call &#8220;negative space&#8221; exploration in a dataset &#8211; unpack the storyline so much that in the end you only have one variable (usually a unit of something).

				<description><![CDATA[This visualization, “Are Democrats/Republicans Winning the Race for Congress?”, shows FiveThirtyEight’s aggregation of generic ballot polls – ie, polls that ask citizens whether they plan to vote for Democrats or Republicans in November. I think their audience is relatively well-educated people with an interest in politics but who don’t work in politics or follow it intensely.  I also think their audience is younger – 20 and 30-somethings – since their content is wells suited to &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/02/10/presentation-of-fivethirtyeights-poll-tracker/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Presentation of FiveThirtyEight&#8217;s poll tracker</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The scenario of violence in Brazil is alarming. In 2016, 61,600 people died victims of homicide in Brazil. This number is comparable in magnitude to the victims of an atomic bomb. Inside a scenario of high violence, it&#8217;s necessary to understand how the different types of violence occur. Between 2009 and 2016, almost 22 thousand people died in Brazil due to police action—more than 4,200 only in 2016. The victims were 99% man, 81,8% of &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/02/08/police-violence-in-brazil/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Police Violence in Brazil</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/01/us/elections/nine-percent-of-america-selected-trump-and-clinton.html This short story from the New York Times is one of my absolute favorites, the data are simple: it&#8217;s just US population data, and voter turnout. The goal here is simple: give an understanding of who votes in primaries in the US electoral system. Narrowly, the audience are readers of the New York Times, but the more implicit target is really those interested in the then-ongoing primaries. I think the simplicity of the setup &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/02/08/only-9-of-america-chose-trump-and-clinton-as-the-nominees/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">&#8220;Only 9% of America Chose Trump and Clinton as the Nominees&#8221;</span></a>]]></description>

The like is http://senseable.mit.edu/mit-world The data connects each international student&#8217;s home country with MIT. The map draws an arch between MIT and one country&#8217;s centroid. For example, if a student is from Canada, an arc is drawn between Canada&#8217;s center and MIT. The arc is colored blue for undergraduate students and &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/02/08/where-mit-international-students-come-from/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Where MIT International Students Come From?</span></a>]]></description>

This data piece is made up of a grid of 800 balloons which mark the point between one’s real age and the age at which they would like to die, contrasting the information with their gender.

However, this visualization created by a UK appliance company called ADC provides a different perspective on chip packaging. Targeted at chip lovers, it looks into the amount of air in chip packets produced by major brands and investigates whether or not the manufacturers&#8217; claims are true. It concludes that chip packet with more air has &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/02/08/how-much-air-is-in-your-bag-of-crisps/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">How Much Air is in Your Bag of Crisps?</span></a>]]></description>
