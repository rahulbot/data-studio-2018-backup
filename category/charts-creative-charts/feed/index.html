				<description><![CDATA[Group members: Kalli Retzepi, Sofia Reinach, Olivia Brode-Roger, Alicia Ouyang The datasets we focused on are the tree census and traffic volume of New York City. As the initiative to increase nature in cities pushes forward and population of cities grow, the number and health of trees are growing as the number and duration of cars in New York, and are sometimes are odds with each other, as more residents means the need to find &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/03/08/trees-of-new-york-one-city-two-life-conditions-summary/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Trees of New York &#8211; One City, Two Life Conditions (Summary)</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[“Branching Out Across New York” Team members: Helen Bailey Margaret Sands Marc Esposito Gomez Maddie Pelz The data say that the number of trees, as well as the most common species of trees, differ across NYC’s five boroughs. These differences create very different landscapes that can impact the experience of each neighborhood. We want to tell this story because the more people know about the trees that make up their neighborhood landscape, the more invested &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/03/08/branching-out-across-new-york/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Branching Out Across New York</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Title: In Manhattan Image: Team Member Names: Haley Meisenholder, Rikhav Shah, Mitchel Myers Summary: The data says that trees take up a small fraction of land area in Manhattan. We want to tell this story because trees should have an equitable share of space. Further, the addition of more trees to Manhattan could greatly enhance its livability. For our data, we compare the land area of trees in Manhattan to several other groups: people, cars, parkland, and all &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/03/08/sketch-1-in-manhattan/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Sketch 1: In Manhattan</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The data say that most Hubway riders keep riding through adverse weather conditions like rain and heat. We want to tell this story because we want to celebrate Hubway riders’ resilience and illustrate how important biking and Hubway is to life in Boston. Our data sources included all Hubway trips taken between 2015 and 2017 (excluding December 2016), and the weather (high temperature and precipitation events) for every day in that time period.  Our presentation &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/03/08/bostons-weather-warriors-by-scott-gilman-and-jay-dev/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Boston&#8217;s Weather Warriors, by Scott Gilman and Jay Dev</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The data says that some of the largest economies are far from meeting their Paris Agreement CO2 reduction targets.   We wanted to tell this story because the ability to credibly commit to sustainable practices will be essential to preventing catastrophic climate changes. Just as many individuals commit to lose weight but fail to follow through, many national regimes to reduce carbon emissions are off track. To make this issue more relatable to our audience, we &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2018.datatherapy.org/2018/03/08/doctors-orders-for-co2-emissions-reduction/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Doctor&#8217;s Orders for CO2 Emissions Reduction</span></a>]]></description>
